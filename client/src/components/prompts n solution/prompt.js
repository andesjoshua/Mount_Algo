        "Three players, a mage, a barkeep, and a knight, are playing a game where they each take turns moving. The mage goes first, followed by the barkeep, then the knight, then back to the mage. The seventh turn is the mage's. Who's turn is the 867th turn?",
    
        "The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is 1^2 + 2^2+ ... 10^2 = 385. The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is, (1+2+...+10)^2 == 55^2 = 3025. Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 - 385 = 2640. Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.",
