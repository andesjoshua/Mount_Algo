        "If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.",
    
        "The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is 1^2 + 2^2+ ... 10^2 = 385. The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is, (1+2+...+10)^2 == 55^2 = 3025. Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 - 385 = 2640. Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum."
